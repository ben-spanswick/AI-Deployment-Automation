# AI Box Deployment Fix Session Summary

## Overview
This session focused on fixing critical issues with the AI Box deployment platform after a system reset that broke ComfyUI, SD Forge, and the dashboard. The primary issues were CUDA version conflicts and services not displaying properly in the dashboard.

## Key Problems Identified

### 1. CUDA Version Conflict
- **Issue**: System has CUDA 12.9 driver, but SD Forge requires CUDA 12.1 toolkit libraries
- **Symptoms**: SD Forge failing with "libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8: cannot open shared object file"
- **Root Cause**: Missing CUDA 12.1 runtime libraries that applications depend on

### 2. Dashboard Service Detection
- **Issue**: Dashboard not showing all services dynamically
- **Symptoms**: Only showing 3-4 services instead of 11+
- **Root Cause**: Original dashboard used separate frontend/backend architecture with file dependencies

### 3. ComfyUI GPU Access
- **Issue**: ComfyUI failing to initialize properly
- **Symptoms**: Container restarting with cuDNN errors
- **Root Cause**: Wrong Docker image and missing shared memory configuration

### 4. n8n Security
- **Issue**: n8n failing with secure cookie errors
- **Symptoms**: Container continuously restarting
- **Root Cause**: Missing N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false environment variable

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. CUDA Compatibility Fix
Integrated CUDA 12.1 library mounts directly into setup.sh:

```yaml
# Added to SD Forge service (lines 1393-1398)
volumes:
  - /usr/local/cuda-12.1/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:ro
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so.1:/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcuda.so.1:ro
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn.so.8:/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn.so.8:ro
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8:/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8:ro
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcublasLt.so.11:/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcublasLt.so.11:ro
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcublas.so.11:/usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcublas.so.11:ro
```

### 2. Shared Memory Configuration
Added shm_size to GPU services to fix PyTorch memory errors:

```yaml
# Added to both forge and comfyui services
shm_size: 8gb
```

### 3. Unified Dashboard Solution
Created a single-container dashboard (dashboard-unified.py) that:
- Embeds HTML/CSS/JS directly in Python to avoid file dependencies
- Uses subprocess to run docker commands instead of Python SDK
- Properly parses docker output with: `output = output.replace(' < /dev/null', '')`
- Detects ALL services on ai-network with proper categorization
- Updates every 2 seconds for real-time monitoring

### 4. Service Fixes
- **SD Forge**: Added --no-download-sd-model flag to start without models
- **ComfyUI**: Changed to yanwk/comfyui-boot:cu121 image for CUDA 12.1 compatibility
- **n8n**: Added N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false environment variable

## Technical Details

### CUDA Library Mapping
The fix maps host CUDA 12.1 libraries into containers at runtime:
- Host libraries at: `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`
- Mounted to: `/usr/local/cuda/lib64/`
- Includes: libcuda, libcudnn, libcudnn_ops_infer, libcublas, libcublasLt

### Dashboard Architecture
The unified dashboard:
- Single Python/Flask application on port 80
- No external file dependencies
- Direct docker CLI integration
- Real-time service detection and categorization
- GPU metrics monitoring
- Service control (start/stop/restart)

### Service Categories
Services are automatically categorized:
- **LLM Services**: LocalAI, Ollama
- **Image Generation**: SD Forge, ComfyUI
- **Automation**: n8n
- **Database**: ChromaDB
- **Audio**: Whisper
- **Monitoring**: Dashboard, DCGM Exporter

## Files Modified

### 1. /home/mandrake/AI-Deployment/setup.sh
- Integrated all CUDA fixes directly (no separate patches)
- Added CUDA library mounts for Forge
- Added shm_size for GPU services
- Updated n8n environment variables

### 2. /home/mandrake/AI-Deployment/dashboard-unified.py
- Complete rewrite as single-file solution
- Embedded HTML/CSS/JS
- Docker CLI integration
- Service categorization logic
- GPU metrics collection

### 3. /home/mandrake/AI-Deployment/cuda-fixes.md
- Documented CUDA compatibility issues
- Added shared memory requirement explanation
- Technical details on library dependencies

## Results

The final deployment successfully shows all 11 services:
```
Services found: 11
  - dashboard (running)
  - dcgm-exporter (running)
  - dashboard-backend (running)
  - localai (running)
  - chromadb (running)
  - ollama (running)
  - comfyui (running)
  - n8n (restarting)
  - forge (running)
  - dcgm (stopped)
  - whisper (running)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **CUDA Compatibility**: Applications built for specific CUDA versions need those exact libraries, even if newer drivers are installed
2. **Shared Memory**: GPU frameworks require significant shared memory for inter-process communication (default 64MB is insufficient)
3. **Docker Output Parsing**: Docker CLI adds artifacts like `< /dev/null` that must be cleaned
4. **Single Container Design**: Eliminates file dependencies and simplifies deployment

## Remaining Considerations

1. n8n still showing as "restarting" - may need additional configuration
2. ComfyUI initialization issues may require further investigation
3. DCGM service is stopped - may need to check if it's needed

## User Requirements Met
